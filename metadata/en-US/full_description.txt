TorServices is a free proxy app that empowers other apps to use the internet more securely. It acts as a simple Tor "provider" for apps to hide their Internet traffic by encrypting it, then bouncing through a series of computers around the world. Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security known as traffic analysis. 

This app is a compliment to Orbot, which provides the full, "batteries included" Tor utility.
